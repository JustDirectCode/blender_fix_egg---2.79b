**General Info**

Requires https://github.com/rdb/blender-egg-importer for ACTUALLY importing .egg files!!!
This is simply optimisations for Toontown models.
Intended for Blender 2.79b or below only! Will not work on higher versions, such as Blender 2.8+

You will also need to have .png files in your textures location. Contact me at @blockobun on Twitter, or blockobun#0001 on discord for more information. This is because .jpg and .rgb files do not convert properly in Blender.

Supports exporting to Roblox (fbx)!

**Install Instructions**

Firstly, please *only* download the file "blender_fix_egg-2.79b.zip" from this repository, and not the "source code" as that is usually outdated.
Install by opening Blender and going to User Preferences > Add-ons >  Install Add-on from File > blender_fix_egg-2.79b.zip
Then go to User Preferences > Add-ons > Development, and select the checkbox for "Development: Toontown .egg Updater.
