**General Info**

Requires https://github.com/rdb/blender-egg-importer for ACTUALLY importing .egg files!!!
This is just optimised for Toontown models.
Intended for Blender 2.79b or below only! Will not work on higher versions, such as 2.8+

You will also need to have .png files in your textures location. Contact me a @blockobun for more information! .jpg and .rgb files do not convert properly.
Supports exporting to Roblox!
